Before the start of new sprint, at the end of the old one. 

A **burndown chart** is a visual tool commonly used in **agile project management** (especially Scrum) to track the progress of a project over time. It shows how much work remains versus time, helping teams and stakeholders quickly see whether they're on track to meet their goals.

### ðŸ“‰ **What a Burndown Chart Looks Like**

- **X-axis**: Time (e.g., days in a sprint or weeks in a project)
    
- **Y-axis**: Amount of work left (typically measured in story points, tasks, or hours)
    
- A **downward-sloping line** indicates work being completed.
    
- Often includes:
    
    - **Ideal burndown line**: The perfect pace to finish on time
        
    - **Actual burndown line**: Whatâ€™s actually happening

### âœ… **Why Use It**

- Monitors sprint or project progress
    
- Identifies scope creep or delays early
    
- Encourages team accountability
    
- Helps with planning and forecasting
